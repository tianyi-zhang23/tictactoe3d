# tictactoe3d
A 3D tic-tac-toe game in command line written in C++
The rule of the game is identical to that of a regular tic-tac-toe, other than the fact that now the board is 3d. This means that a party wins when it 
- (1) Has three dots along one line (including diagonal) in one of the three boards or across the three boards
- (2) Has three dots at the same position in all of three boards
